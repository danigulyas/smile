# Smile

Small lib for converting emoji mappers to emoji characters, like in Slack messages:

```elixir
import Smile
convert_text("my emoji game is :ok_hand_sign:")
# > "my emoji game is ðŸ‘Œ"
```

This is just an experiment to examine metaprogramming in Elixir, there's known limitations:
    
1. Emojis in the middle of other don't work, ex.: ":woo:pile_of_poo:hoo:" would not convert the `:pile_of_poo:` in the middle
